USAGE:

python    pavoda_read_v3.py    PADOVA_ISOCHRONE_FILE_NAME  COLUMNS_NAMES   OUPUT_FILE_NAME

PADOVA_ISOCHRONE_FILE_NAME - padova isochrone file from the website http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd
COLUMNS_NAMES              - the filters you would like to use, the first column MUST be M_ini
OUPUT_FILE_NAME            - name of the file ready to be used in gcmd package

TROUBLESHOOTING:
Script is tuned to work for the padova cmd version 2.5. If structure of the file changes significantly,
the most likely part to break in the script is "CLEANER". This will have to be modified.
